# ASUS K53SC OpenCore
Opencore efi folder for asus k53sc. it kinda sucks but it was annoying to set up so im archiving it

## What doesn't work

- Graphics acceleration post 10.13 (you can get it working with oclp or whatever though probably)
- USB 3 port post-booting, webcam. USB mapping may help, i dont care anymore
- didnt try the card reader bc i dont have any cards to read
- booting from hard drive/ssd. cant figure out why
- graphics acceleration used to be very finnicky but its been decent lately???

## How to use

follow along this guide https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/, you can skip the bits where you actually do stuff, but you do need to
- format the flash drive
- shove the stuff in there
- get the macos installer dmg
- set upthe serial number and whatever else numbers the smbios wants

All of those are described in the guide, i'd recommend reading the whole thing too given this isnt rly complete so ull probably need to put some work in for this to be like okay-ish
